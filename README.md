# WireDetectionForRotorcraft
 Wire Detection For Rotorcraft 
 
 This system is designed for providing real time wire detection for light weight rotorcrafts.
 
 System uses machine learning, transfer learning (using VGG-19 architecture) and image processing techniques with Python.
 
 You can find detailed information about system in the papers attached.
 
 You can also find an example video about the systems performance which highligts strong and weak points of the developed project.
 
 Due to file size limitations of github I couldn't post the entire project. You can download the whole system with the link below.
